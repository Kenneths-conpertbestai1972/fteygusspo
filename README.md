Ok wow so just stumbled out of Phule and holy moly, what a ride. It’s like being caught in a blender set to “chaotic” but, you know, in a good way? Still got popcorn crumbs like, everywhere, and my back's killing me from this seat but who even cares when your brain’s doing somersaults.

There was this part where... I dunno, the protagonist is like suddenly in this surreal dreamscape—felt a bit like the time when I tried to find my friends at a carnival and ended up in the funhouse instead. Everything’s distorted, colors yelling at your eyeballs. It was delightful and kind of intimidating at the same time.

> Oh and the soundtrack! Dude, it’s like being serenaded by alien whales — does that even make sense? But it’s true! Like, I could feel the vibrations in my marrow, you know what I mean?

So there’s this recurring thing with a set of keys, right? At first, I just thought it was like they were just losing their keys a lot, which I totally relate to, but then it's like, metaphorical or whatever. Also made me think, do I need new keys?

And oh god, the whole scene with those paper planes made it feel like a gazillion butterflies had just descended onto my head and I couldn’t brush them off. Stunning visuals but also, madness! Would recommend wearing a hat if that was real life.

Wait, did you ask me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or should you just go and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Not sure if either’s a good idea right now, my head’s still spinning.

> At one point, I swear the carpet on the theater floor was part of the story too — shame it was sticky with soda, otherwise it might’ve flown away. Couldn’t stop thinking about how much it mirrored the texture of fate (??).

Darn, must’ve been some kind of wizardry with how time just melted away. Hours felt like seconds. Seconds felt like parsnips. One of those paradox things.

, Btw, they should serve coffee in theaters. Or maybe just a good pillow for my back? Would’ve paid gold for either.

Here’s something from another universe, slipped into this chaotic note: 
```python
def is_this_event_real(observation):
    return observation  ???
```
And yep, even my brain’s not sure about that last bit. Catch you later.
